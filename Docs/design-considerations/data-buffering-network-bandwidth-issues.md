# Data Buffering Network Bandwidth Issues

When dealing with large quantities of data it is important to consider how the data is transported and accessed.  This project brings together a variety of data sources to achieve it's goal.  In some cases, such as the Schwab API, the data source at a remote location is queried directly and responses are returned directly to the executing code.  In other cases such as the HFT Alert Burst Monitoring data there are servers running on the local machine that use optimized protocol to reduce the bandwidth necessary on the external network and to improve the response time and bandwidth requirements of requests.&#x20;

The data sources can also be parsed into types of sources.  There are HTML endpoints and streaming endpoints.  The HTML endpoints return snapshot information that is indicative of information at a particular point in time. In general, if dynamic information such as events per second is the data of interest streaming sources are more suitable.  It may be possible to derive rate information from the differences between one snapshot and another if quantity of events is included in HTML snapshots, but is this not guaranteed to be the case.
