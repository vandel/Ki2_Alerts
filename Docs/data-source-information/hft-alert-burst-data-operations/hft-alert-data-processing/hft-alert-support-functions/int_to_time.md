# int\_to\_time

This Python function, `int_to_time`, is designed to convert an integer representation of time into a `time` object.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the function does:

1. The function takes one argument, `time_int`, which is expected to be an integer.
2. It converts the integer to a string using the `str` function, and then pads the string with leading zeros to ensure it's 6 characters long using the `zfill` method. This is done to ensure that the time is always represented as `HHMMSS` (HourMinuteSecond), even if the initial integer was not six digits long.
3. It then extracts the hour, minute, and second from the string by slicing it. The first two characters are assumed to represent the hour, the next two characters represent the minute, and the last two characters represent the second. Each of these slices is converted back to an integer using the `int` function.
4. Finally, it creates a `time` object with the extracted hour, minute, and second, and returns this object.

In summary, this function converts an integer representation of time into a `time` object. For example, the integer `123456` would be converted to a time representing 12:34:56.
